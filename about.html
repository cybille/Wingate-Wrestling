  <h3>
    We are not just teammates, we are family. We wrestle together, share sweat and tears, argue, laugh, win and lose together. We most definitely eat together
    (seriously, you can't get away eating anything by yourself without at least one persone taking a bite out of it.)
    <p>
    We have holiday events (lots of food to lose the next day on the mat) and the alumni network is a strong one.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hope you have good grades because you cant hide your report card like you can with your parents.
    We help each other the best we can with any subjects we have trouble with or advice we need.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strong Alumni Network
  </p>
